# Parallel Contract

### Doubts and Issues

The following is a collection of doubts and issues that came up in individual conversations and group discussions.

###### Definition

There are different approaches to legal documents that regulate business relationships. Those can be actual contracts, specifically adapted to a job, that have to be signed by both parties. Or it can simply be a list of conditions that the designer attaches to an estimate, obliging the client to acknowledge and accept before beginning work.

This proposal aims for the latter.

###### Universality

The original idea was to formulate the contract as openly as possible so that it could apply to different professions and countries.

Practical: a photographer may need other terms than an illustrator. How can the same document serve both?

Legal: each country and state has different laws. Can a contract be formulated that is useful in varying jurisdictions?

###### Language
It surely helps to be as clear as possible, but does the tone have to be as serious as you would expect? Is it necessary to use legal terms or can the phrasing be more colloquial? 

###### Identity
Playing with the aforementioned points, the designer may try to introduce their own identity into the contract. If the phrasing of a legal document is personal and its conditions are a description of their approach, can that contract accurately reflect the creator’s identity?

### General Concepts

These points are supposed to explain the general concepts while approaching a first draft of the common contract.

###### Obligations
If the designer outlines, in combination with the estimate, what they commit to do, it should also be clear what they do not commit to. Established roles will help to defend responsibilities.

###### Procedure
It can be useful to give an overview to the client of the typical stages a project goes through. It can be a problem however to make a general description apply to a specific project. Therefore an additional document, attached to budget and conditions, may be necessary to draw an particular project outline.

Break up the workload into separate packages. Formulate what has to be done. Describe what the expected outcome is, when and how it will be presented to the client. Make clear if the client’s participation or decision is necessary, and what happens if those are delayed.

###### License
The most difficult part to explain to the client can be the concept of acquiring a license instead of the design itself.

Firstly, the designer has to be remunerated for the creation of the design.

Secondly, the client has to license if they want to use the designer’s work. Usually this is expressed as percentage, relative to the designer’s fees. This percentage can vary, depending on the extent and duration the client intents to use the work.

###### Payment
Getting paid at the end of long projects can be a strain on the designer’s finances. Many suggest upfront payments. This can also be arranged progressively, alongside the completion of packages (see Procedure).

Another model is to issue an invoice at the end of each month for the workload completed during that period.
