### Introduction

Many designers choose to work freelance for reasons of creative liberty and in order to establish and grow their own practice. A big part of that however is business: administration and negotiation. 

As independent creators of course we’re responsable of improving and maintaining our own working conditions. In my experience many times that’s the first thing that gets lost on the way.

Also, in education these topics don’t get a lot of attention. Next to conceptual and formal

Working on your own has another disadvantage: each isolated individual has to solve the same problems as their peers, over and over again. Everyone actually faces the same problems and fights the same struggles, but there’s no culture of sharing these doubts.

One goal of this initiative is to establish a common sense of a fair business relationship between design professionals and their clients. In hope to thus help avoid abusive working conditions (both self-inflicted and from clients) and to facilitate the start-off of new independent practices.

In turn, this common contract could function as future point of reference for educators and provide extra-curricular material.
